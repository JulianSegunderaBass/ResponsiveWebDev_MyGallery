<!-- OVERVIEW -->

Image grids are very satisfying layouts to work with, especially with what CSS grid makes possible. Static layouts like this one are relatively simple to make and have great visual impact on a site. One of my bucket list tasks is to learn how to create more complex and fluid grids in the "Pinterest" style for larger, data-driven sites.
